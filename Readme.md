Ride Booking API - A Scalable Ride-Sharing Platform
üéØ Project Overview
This project is a secure, scalable, and role-based backend API for a ride-booking system, similar to Uber or Pathao. Built with Express.js, TypeScript, and Mongoose, it provides a robust platform for managing ride requests and fulfillment. The system supports three distinct user roles: Riders, who can book and manage their rides; Drivers, who can accept and complete rides; and Admins, who oversee the entire system.

The architecture is modular and production-ready, focusing on clean code, security, and scalability. It features JWT-based authentication, role-based authorization, secure password hashing, and comprehensive data validation.

‚ú® Core Features
üîê Authentication & Authorization
Secure Registration: New users can register with securely hashed passwords using bcrypt.

JWT-Based Login: Users receive accessToken and refreshToken upon successful login for secure API access.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): A powerful middleware protects routes, ensuring that only users with the appropriate roles (Admin, Driver, Rider) can access specific endpoints.

üßç Rider Features
Request a Ride: Riders can request a ride by providing their pickup and destination locations.

View Ride History: Riders can view a complete history of their past rides, including driver details and fare.

Cancel a Ride: Riders can cancel a ride request as long as it has not been accepted by a driver.

üöó Driver Features
Apply to be a Driver: Registered users can apply to become a driver by submitting their license and vehicle details.

Set Availability: Drivers can set their status to Online or Offline to start or stop receiving ride requests.

View Pending Rides (Geo-based): Online drivers can see pending ride requests from riders within a 5km radius of their current location.

Accept/Reject Rides: Drivers can accept or reject available ride requests.

Update Ride Status: Drivers manage the entire ride lifecycle by updating the status from ACCEPTED ‚Üí PICKED_UP ‚Üí IN_TRANSIT ‚Üí COMPLETED.

View Earnings History: Drivers can view a detailed history of their completed rides and their total earnings.

üëë Admin Features
User Management: Admins can view all users and block or unblock their accounts.

Driver Management: Admins can view all driver applications, and approve or reject them.

System Overview: Admins have access to view all users, drivers, and rides in the system.

üöï Ride & Fare Management
Complete Ride Lifecycle: The system tracks the entire lifecycle of a ride with detailed status history.

Distance-Based Fare Calculation: When a ride is completed, the fare is automatically calculated based on the distance between the pickup and destination locations (‚Ç¨20/km + base fare).
